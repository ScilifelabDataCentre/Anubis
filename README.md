Anubis is a web-based system to handle calls, proposal submission,
reviews, decisions and grant dossiers. It allows:

- The publication of calls.
- The creation, editing and submission of proposals.
- A person who wants to prepare and submit a proposal must create an
  account in the system.
- The administrator configures which accounts should be reviewers of
  the proposals in a call.
- The administrator records the decisions that the reviewers (or other group) have made.
- Documents and information related to the grants awarded to successful proposals
  can be handled by the system.

Some of the steps in a typical worflow are illustrated in the screenshots in the

The admin is a user account which has full privileges for the Anubis
site. She may perform all operations that are possible to do via the
web interface.

### User account handling

- The admin may register user accounts.
- The admin may edit, enable or disable user accounts.
- An admin may set other user accounts to be admin.

### Call handling

- The admin creates a call, and edits its content.
- The admin controls when a call becomes published by setting the
  **opens** date of the call.
- The admin controls the deadline for creating and submitting
  proposals to a call by setting the **closes** date.
- The contents of a call (the input fields for proposals, reviews and
  decisions) can be edited whenever by the admin, but when a call has
  been published it should be kept intact, or users will be confused.

### Reviewers and reviews

- The admin may set a user account as a **reviewer** in a call.
- The admin may also set a user account as a **chair** for a
  call. This is a special type of reviewer who has slightly higher
  privileges than ordinary reviewers.
- The admin must create the **review** instances for each reviewer and
  proposal in a call. It is up to the admin to decide which proposals
  a reviewer must review.

### Proposal handling

- The admin is allowed to edit and submit user's proposals. Of course,
  this should be done only in special circumstances.

level: 1

The number of your unfinalized reviews is displayed on a yellow
background in the top menu. If there is no such yellow marker, your
reviews are done.

#### How to get the proposals

- As a reviewer, you have access to all submitted proposals in the call.
- Depending on the policy for the call, you should read all or only
  some of the proposals.
- To download all proposals and their attached files, go to the call page. In the
  right-hand upper corner, there are two small black buttons:
  1. "Submitted proposals Excel file", which allows you to download
     the information in all submitted proposals in Excel format. This
     does not contain the files attached to proposals, if any.
  2. "Submitted proposals zip file", which contains the above Excel
     file, **and** all files attached to the proposals. The naming of
     the files indicates which one belongs to which proposal.
- It is also possible to browse the proposals in a list display by
  clicking the blue button by the item "All proposals" on the call
  page.

#### How to fill in your reviews

1. Click on the item "My reviews" in the top menu.
   - The list of all reviews for your user account are shown in a table,
     which can be sorted by any column.
   - **Note** that the table may have more than one page, depending on
     the number of proposals. Use the page selector at the bottom right of
     the table.
2. Click on the link "Review" to view the review of the proposal on
   that line in the table.
3. Edit the review.
4. Click **Finalize** to indicate that you are done with the review.
   - Until the **due** date for reviews in the call, you may
     **Unfinalize** a review if you wish to resume editing it.
5. To view the proposal of the review, click the link to the proposal
   in the title. (Tip: do right-click and "Open in new tab".)
6. Before the **due** date, ensure that all your reviews have been
   finalized.

### Reviewer: Basic information

- A user account is set as a reviewer for a specific call by the admin
  of the Anubis system.
- The admin also creates the review instances for the proposals for
  each reviewer. A reviewer cannot create the review instances, only the admin
  can do this.
- Depending on the policy for the call, a reviewer may have to write a
  review for all or only some proposals. The admin handles this by creating those
  review instances that the reviewer should fill in.
- The content (input fields) of the reviews are set for the call by the admin.
- The reviews of a call have a **due** date, before which all reviews must
  have been finalized by the reviewers.
- There may be a chair designated for a call. This is a reviewer
  heading the reviewer group. He or she has additional privileges.

### Reviewer privileges

- The reviewer may view all proposals in the call.
- The reviewer can edit her review instance.
- The reviewers cannot create or delete review instances.
- The chair, if any, of a call may create review instances.
- The chair, if any, may view all reviews.
- A reviewer may view finalized reviews by other reviewers only if the
  admin allows it for the call.

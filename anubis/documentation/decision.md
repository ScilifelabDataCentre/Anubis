The administrator or review chair can create a decision entity for
each proposal. The fields of the decision are configured in the call
by the call owner. Thus, a decision may contain more information for
the proposer than just the accept/reject decision.

The call owner or the chair of the call may edit and finalize the
decision.

The administrator may make the decision for each proposal viewable by
the respective submitter by setting an access flag in the
call.

Currently, no email is automatically sent by the Anubis system to the
submitter when the decision is finalized.

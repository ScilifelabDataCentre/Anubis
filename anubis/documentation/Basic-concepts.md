Basic concepts
==============

The basic concepts used in the Anubis system are described briefly
here. Follow the links for more in-depth description.

Call
----

A call in Anubis is a call for proposals. It contains a description of
the call, optionally with documents.

The admin creates a call, and sets up the input fields for the
proposal, the reviews and the decision for each proposal.

A call has an open date, which defines when the call becomes publicly
available so that proposals can be created by users.

The call has a closes date, after which is not possible for a user to
create a proposal or to submit it.

Proposal
--------

A proposal is created within an open call by a user. Only one proposal
in each call can be created by a user. The user fills in the proposal
input fields.

When all required input fields have been filled in, the user may
submit the proposal. Note that the call must still be open for a
proposal within in to be submitted!

Anubis is a system to handle calls, proposal submission and reviews.

It is based on a number of types of entities.

### Call

[A call](/documentation/call) is a call for proposals. In the Anubis
system, it is a container for proposals, reviews and decisions.

### Proposal

[A proposal](/documentation/proposal) can be created and written by
anyone who has an account in the Anubis system.  A proposal is always
made in the context of a specific call.

The proposal must be submitted by the user before the **closes** date of the call.

### Review

[The review](/documentation/review) of proposal within a call is set
up by the administrator. This includes defining what information the
reviewers must provide, including scores or rank, and which accounts
should be reviewers of which proposals.

### Decision

[The decision](/documentation/decision) is a way of documenting what
the result of the review of a proposal is.

### Grant dossier

[A grant dossier](/documentation/grant-dossier) is a means for the researcher
and staff to share information about a successful proposal.

### Input field types

Most of the above entities are configured for each call to provide a
set of input fields, to be filled in by the user, reviewer or
staff. There are a number of [input field types](/documenation/input-field-types)
that may be used.

### Account

[An account](/documentation/account) is the representation of a user
in the Anubis system. A user must have an account to be able to write
a proposal. An account may have different roles, which gives different
sets of privileges.

### Privileges

Different user roles have different sets of [privileges](/documentation/privileges),
which determine what they are allowed to do within the Anubis system.

A call in the Anubis system is a representation of a a call for
proposals. It is the basis for all other entities in the Anubis
system.

A call has an identifier, a title, and a description. It may have
documents attached. It contains the descriptions and definitions for
proposals, reviews, decisions and grant dossiers.

A call is prepared and handled by a call owner, which is either an
administrator or an account which hase been given this privilege by
the administrator. The call owner sets up the
[input fields](/documentation/input-field-types) for the proposal, and
the reviews, the decision and grant dossier for each proposal.

A user with an account in the Anubis system  can create a
[proposal](/documentation/proposal) within an open call. The structure
of the proposal is determined by the call owner when setting up the
call.

A call has an **opens** date, from which it becomes visible to the
world. It has a **closes** date, which determines the last time a
proposal can be submitted in the call.

The **opens** date of a call defines when the call becomes publicly
available so that proposals can be created by users. The call cannot
be open unless this has been set.

After the **closes** date of a call, a user can no longer create, edit
or submit a proposal in it.

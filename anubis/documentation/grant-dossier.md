A grant dossier contains information about the grant which is the
result of positive decision for the proposal. It may contain
information about the grant and documents provided by the grant giver,
or by the grantee, for example grant conditions, budget, agreement,
and similar.

A grant dossier which has valid values in all required fields is
automatically set as complete.

A grant dossier is created by the administrator or staff, who also
configure the input fields in it. The proposal owner (which presumably
is the grant receiver) can view and edit it.

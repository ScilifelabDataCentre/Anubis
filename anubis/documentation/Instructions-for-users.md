# Instructions for users

The number of your unsubmitted proposals is displayed on a yellow
background in the top menu. If there is no such yellow marker, your
proposals, if any, have all been submitted.

## Create a user account

- In order to create a proposal in a call, a user must have an account
  in the system.
- To create an account in the Anubis system, go to the page
  [Register a user account](/user/register) and follow the
  instructions.
- When a new user account has been enabled, you will recieve an email
  describing how to set your password.
- Once you have an enabled account with the password set, you may
  create a proposal from an open call.

## Create a proposal

- Go to the page of the open call. All open calls are displayed on the
  home page.
- Unless you have not already created a proposal in the call, there is
  a button in the call page allowing you to do so.
- **Create** the proposal and fill in the values for the input fields.
- You may save the unfinished proposal and return to **editing** it later.
- Once the required fields of the proposal have been filled in correctly,
  you may **submit** it.
- A proposal that has been submitted can longer be edited.
- As long as the call is open, you may un-submit your proposal if you
  wish to edit it further, or even delete it.
- Once the call's deadline for submission has been passed, the user
  may no longer submit a proposal. **Be sure to submit your proposal
  before the deadline!**

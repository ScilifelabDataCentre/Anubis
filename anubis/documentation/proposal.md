A proposal is created within an open call by a user, who must be
logged in to an Anubis [account](/documentation/account). Only one
proposal in each call can be created by any given user.

The user fills in the proposal [input fields](/documentation/input-field-types),
which are configured in the call by the call owner.

Some input fields may be optional, while some many be required. This is defined when
the call owner creates and edits the input fields for the proposals of the call.

An input field has an allowed type of input, such as text, integer, file, etc.

When all required input fields have been filled in with values of the
correct type, the user may submit the proposal. A proposal may be
un-submitted by the user while the call is open.

If the call has been closed, it is no longer possible to submit a
proposal, nor to edit it in any way. The proposal can still be viewed
by the user after the call has been closed.

An admin has additional privileges for handling proposals, see [Instructions
for administrators](/documentation/instruction-for-admins).

A proposal is created within an open call by a user, who must be
logged in to an Anubis [account](/documentation/account). Only one
proposal in each call can be created by any given user.

The user fills in the proposal [input
fields](/documentation/input-field-types), which are configured in the
call by the call owner..

Some input fields may be optional, while some many be required. All
have an allowed type of input. When all required input fields have
been filled in with values of the correct type, the user may submit
the proposal. A proposal may be un-submitted while the call is open.

If the call has been closed, it is no longer possible to submit a
proposal, nor to edit it in any way. The proposal can still be viewed
by the user after the call has been closed.

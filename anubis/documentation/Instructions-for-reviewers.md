# Instructions for reviewers

The number of your unfinalized reviews is displayed on a yellow
background in the top menu. If there is no such yellow marker, your
reviews are done.

1. Click on the item "My reviews" in the top menu.
   - The list of all reviews for your user account are shown in a table,
     which can be sorted by any column.
   - **Note** that the table may have more than one page, depending on
     the number of proposals. Use the page selector at the bottom right of
     the table.
2. Click on the link "Review" to view the review of the proposal on
   that line in the table.
3. Edit the review.
4. Click **Finalize** to indicate that you are done with the review.
   - Until the **due** date for reviews in the call, you may
     **Unfinalize** a review if you wish to resume editing it.
5. To view the proposal of the review, click the link to the proposal
   in the title. (Tip: do right-hand click and "Open in new tab".)
6. Before the **due** date, ensure that all your reviews have been
   finalized.

### Basic reviewer information

- A user account is set as a reviewer for a specific call by the admin
  of the Anubis system.
- The admin also creates the review instances for the proposals for
  each reviewer.
- Depending on the policy for the call, a reviewer may have to write a
  review for all or only some proposals.
- The content (input fields) of the reviews are set for the call by the admin.
- The reviews of a call have a **due** date, before which all reviews must
  have been finalized by the reviewers.

### Reviewer privileges

- The reviewer may view all proposals in the call.
- A reviewer may not have a proposal of her own in the call.
- The reviewer cannot create or delete review instances, only edit them.
- The chair, if any, of a call may create review instances.
- A reviewer may view finalized reviews by other reviewers only if the
  admin allows it for the call.
